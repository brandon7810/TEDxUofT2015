		<p>TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience</p>
		<p class="small-12 columns"><b>‘A Constellation of Insights’ was chosen as the theme for TEDxUofT 2015.</b> This theme allows for many different interpretations. 
			A constellation represents both individuality and collaboration, illustrating how ‘connecting the dots’ can lead to fantastical discoveries; 
			a concept which can be translated across fields and cultures. While each star can be easily distinguished from its neighbours, 
			it is the collective formation that ultimately produces the picture humans have observed looking up at the heavens. 
			With an ancient history in both creativity and practicality, constellations form the basis of communication; 
			inspiring story-tellers and guiding travellers for thousands of years.</p>

							The 2015 conference will be taking place at the <a href="http://map.utoronto.ca/marker/jjr-macleod-auditorium-entrance" target="_blank">JJR MacLeod Auditorium</a> on the St. George campus.
						</accordion-group>

						<accordion-group heading="When is the conference taking place?" is-open="false">
							TEDxUofT is a full day conference happening on March 15th from 10 am to 6 pm.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="What can I expect at this conference?" is-open="false">
							This full day conference will be an engaging experience featuring UofT's brightest minds and talent. Their ideas will spark discussion during our intermissions, which will feature amazing food and interactive stations that promote the ideals of TED.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="How can I attend the Conference?" is-open="false">
							Each interested attendee has to first submit an online application. We are looking for passionate delegates who are committed to attending the event, who believe strongly in the power of ideas, and who want to share those ideas with others to make a difference in the world. We will be accepting delegates based on the application alone, so make sure to highlight your best aspects and impress us! Applications will be available for two weeks on the website in February 2015.
						</accordion-group>
				
						<accordion-group heading="How will I know if my application is accepted?" is-open="false">
							We will be emailing all the accepted delegates once the applications close. There will be two rounds of invitations, so don't fret if you don't hear back right away! Once you accept the invitation, you will be able to purchase a ticket, which you will be given more specific instructions for in the invitation.

						<accordion-group heading="Why do I have to apply?" is-open="false">
							TED and TEDx are one of hottest global topics, and so many people are keen in joining this global conversation to learn and be inspired. Therefore the organisers at UofT started local initiative at the University for you to have a personal experience here. LImited spaces so really take this oportunity. Networking atmosphere is often where many ppl connect with future colleagues, and professionals, even spouses.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="How will you select delegates?" is-open="false">
						This is a tri-campus event, and we want that to be represented in our delegates, but we also want to include alumni, staff, professors and the general public. The application allows us to ensure that everyone who attends is a passionate individual who champions the TED ideals. It also shows us which delegates took the time and effort to thoughtfully fill out our application with something longer than a sentence.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="Why is this event tri-campus and not just downtown?" is-open="false">
							Let’s make something clear - to us the University of Toronto isn’t divided by campuses, we are a sole entity that stands for the same core values that can be amplified and celebrated using the TEDx platform. Our team is pretty much 1/3 UTSC, 1/3 UTSG, and 1/3 UTM, and believe that our divers executive team has made the conference better…but it does make physical in person meetings a nightmare to schedule.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="Are you looking for volunteers?" is-open="false">
							We are always on the lookout for individuals who are willing to help us out at the Conference. You can apply <a href="volunteer.html">here</a>.
