			<p><b>‘A Constellation of Insights’ was chosen as the theme for TEDxUofT 2015.</b> This theme allows for many different interpretations. A constellation represents both individuality and collaboration, illustrating how ‘connecting the dots’ can lead to fantastical discoveries; a concept which can be translated across fields and cultures. While each star can be easily distinguished from its neighbours, it is the collective formation that ultimately produces the picture humans have observed looking up at the heavens. With an ancient history in both creativity and practicality, constellations form the basis of communication; inspiring story-tellers and guiding travellers for thousands of years.</p>
