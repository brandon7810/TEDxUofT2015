		<p class="small-12 medium-7 small-centered columns">‘A Constellation of Insights’ was chosen as the theme for TEDxUofT 2015. This theme allows for many different interpretations. A constellation represents both individuality and collaboration, illustrating how ‘connecting the dots’ can lead to fantastical discoveries; a concept which can be translated across fields and cultures. While each star can be easily distinguished from its neighbours, it is the collective formation that ultimately produces the picture humans have observed looking up at the heavens.
			<br>With an ancient history in both creativity and practicality, constellations form the basis of communication;
			inspiring story-tellers and guiding travellers for thousands of years.</p>

				<h2>Samantha Joel</h2>
				<h3>Psychology</h3>
				<p>Samantha explores “the science of love”---taking a scientific approach to the age-old question of how romantic relationships work. Decisions such as whether to pursue a particular love interest, whether to commit to a new dating partner, or whether to end a struggling relationship can have a profound influence on the shape that our lives ultimately take. But how do people make these crucial choices? Samantha Joel is currently exploring this research question as a PhD student in the Psychology Department at the University of Toronto. By studying real-world couples using modern scientific methods, Samantha hopes to uncover useful decision strategies that will ultimately lead to happier, healthier relationships.</p>

				<h2>Ivan Solano</h2>
				<h3>Social Responsibility</h3>
				<p>Adolescence can be a tricky time to navigate, especially for kids with Learning Disabilities. Our speaker, Ivan Solano, has set out to change the way kids learn through disability research, so those with Learning Disabilities only have recess to worry about. Growing up with learning disability (LD) in a world made for neurotypical people set Ivan on a path of discovering other ways to learn. The challenges of learning with LD and the focus on academic weakness became Ivan’s impetus to help and work with disabled people as a physiotherapist and an ergonomist. He was recently awarded the 2014 DiverseCity Fellows Award by Civic Action which gives him the opportunity to fast track LeaD, a collaborative project for kids with LD. Ivan aims to address concerns on self-esteem and confidence that most school kids with LD face.</p>

				<h2>Jeffrey Pilcher</h2>
				<h3>Food</h3>
				<p>What should we eat?
