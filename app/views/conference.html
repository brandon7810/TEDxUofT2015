		<p class="small-12 columns"><b>‘A Constellation of Insights’ was chosen as the theme for TEDxUofT 2015.</b> This theme allows for many different interpretations. 
			A constellation represents both individuality and collaboration, illustrating how ‘connecting the dots’ can lead to fantastical discoveries; 
			a concept which can be translated across fields and cultures. While each star can be easily distinguished from its neighbours, 
			it is the collective formation that ultimately produces the picture humans have observed looking up at the heavens. 
			With an ancient history in both creativity and practicality, constellations form the basis of communication; 
			inspiring story-tellers and guiding travellers for thousands of years.</p>

							The 2015 conference will be taking place at ...
						</accordion-group>

						<accordion-group heading="When is the conference taking place?" is-open="false">
							TEDxUofT is a full day conference happening on March 1st from 9 am to 6 pm.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="What can I expect at this conference?" is-open="false">
							This full day conference will be an engaging experience featuring 11 of the University’s brightest talent, in addition to 2 amazing performers. Stay tuned with our Facebook and Twitter for announcements regarding our speaker lineup, and our performers! Their ideas will spark discussion during our intermissions, which will feature amazing food and interactive stations that promote the ideals of TED.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="How can I attend the Conference?" is-open="false">
							Each interested attendee has to first submit an online application. We are looking for passionate delegates who are committed to attending the event, who believe strongly in the power of ideas, and who want to share those ideas with others to make a difference in the world. We will be accepting delegates based on the application alone, so make sure to highlight your best aspects and impress us!
						</accordion-group>
				
						<accordion-group heading="How will I know if my application is accepted?" is-open="false">
							We will be emailing all the accepted delegates once the applications close. There will be two rounds of invitations, so don't fret if you don't hear back right away! Once you accept the invitation, you will be able to purchase a ticket, which you will be given more specific instructions for in the invitation.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="This conference can’t be free can it? How much does it cost?" is-open="false">
							As of this moment the conference price is expected to be $50. As students we understand just how expensive that is, and how many foot longs that buys you. Our team is working round the clock to round up an even larger selection of sponsors and innovative ideas to reduce the price. We want to be as transparent as possible with our situation. Delegates from last year will question what has made the ticket price rise so much, and the answer is that this year our team has been ambitious in increasing conference attendance to nearly 500 delegates. As you increase delegates so do the costs; that said you can expect much more than you did last year with amazing food, extraordinary speakers and entertainers that by the end you’ll exit the theatre with a giant smile on your face.

						<accordion-group heading="Why do I have to apply?" is-open="false">
							TEDx events are usually invitation only and require an application. This is done for a variety of reasons. We have an application form with the goal to learn more about the delegates (like if you are gluten intolerant, but also what you are passionate about), manage the overwhelming interest for the event, and get you out of your comfort zone since you are unlikely to have a friend to tag along.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="How will you select delegates?" is-open="false">
							This is a tri-campus event, and we want that to be represented in our delegates, but we also want to include alumni, staff, professors and the general public. The application allows us to ensure that everyone who attends is a passionate individual who champions the TED ideals. It also shows us which delegates took the time and effort to thoughtfully fill out our application with something longer than a sentence.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="Why is this event tri-campus and not just downtown?" is-open="false">
							Let’s make something clear - to us the University of Toronto isn’t divided by campuses, we are a sole entity that stands for the same core values that can be amplified and celebrated using the TEDx platform.
Our team is pretty much 1/3 UTSC, 1/3 UTSG, and 1/3 UTM, and believe that our divers executive team has made the conference better…but it does make physical in person meetings a nightmare to schedule.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="I didn't receive an invitation. Are there other ways to be involved with TEDxUofT?" is-open="false">
							Yes! This year, we will be having a simultaneous live stream of the event available for anyone who is interested. This will be completely free and accessible through any device -- as long as you have wifi -- and we will post the access link closer to the date.
						</accordion-group>
					
						<accordion-group heading="Are you looking for volunteers?" is-open="false">
							We are always on the lookout for individuals who are willing to help us out at the Conference. We will be posting more information on our Twitter and Facebook pages closer to the date, so keep your eyes open.
